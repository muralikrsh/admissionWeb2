<b>Terms & Conditions</b>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>
Please read these terms carefully before using the online payment facility. Using the online payment facility on this website indicates that you accept these terms. If you do not accept these terms do not use this facility. 
</p>
All payments are subject to the following conditions:- 
The description of courses are specific to you (i.e. Programme Name, start and end date etc.) when you log in with your unique password. Normally payment is required in advance (i.e. before you commence your programme). 
All Fees quoted are in Indian Rupees. The Bharath University reserves the right to change the fees at any time.
•	Your payment will normally reach the Bharath University account to which you are making a payment within two working days.
•	We cannot accept liability for a payment not reaching the correct Bharath University account due to you quoting an incorrect account number or incorrect personal details. Neither can we accept liability if payment is refused or declined by the credit/debit card supplier for any reason.
•	If the card supplier declines payment the Bharath University is under no obligation to bring this fact to your attention. You should check with your bank/credit/debit card supplier that payment has been deducted from your account.
•	In no event will the Bharath University be liable for any damages whatsoever arising out of the use, inability to use, or the results of use of this site, any websites linked to this site, or the materials or information contained at any or all such sites, whether based on warranty, contract, tort or any other legal theory and whether or not advised of the possibility of such damages. 
Refund Policy
•	If the Customer leaves the Bharath University before they complete their Programme, there shall be no entitlement to a refund of Tuition Fees. 
•	Refunds, if applicable, at the discretion of the Management, will only be made to the debit/credit card used for the original transaction. For the avoidance of doubt nothing in this Policy shall require the Bharath University to refund the Fees (or part thereof) unless such Fees (or part thereof) have previously been paid. 
•	If the website is not updated after the payment of your fees online, verify whether or not your account has been debited. If your account has been debited, then wait for 2 days before you email the Finance Manager, Bharath University (fm@bharathuniv.ac.in) with your payment details to get the site updated.
Security
All payment details which are entered through this payment gateway are encrypted when the Customer, or third party making payment, enters them. Communications to and from the Service Provider's site are encrypted. 

The Bharath University shall not be liable for any failure by the Customer or third party making payment of Fees to properly protect data from being seen on their screen by other persons or otherwise obtained by such persons, during the online payment process or in respect of any omission to provide accurate information in the course of the online payment process.
Service Provider 
Online Payments of Fees can be made by Credit / Debit card or Netbanking. These payments are not collected by the Bharath University directly but by the Service Provider. 

Once payment is received by the Service Provider in cleared funds, the Service Provider will contact the Bharath University to confirm the details of the successful payment made by the Customer, or third party making payment. On receipt of this confirmation the Bharath University will confirm to the Customer that the payment has been received and accepted by the Bharath University. In the event that the Customer does not receive confirmation within 14 days of making the payment it is the responsibility of the Customer to check with the Bharath University that the payment has been accepted. The Customer shall remain responsible for all Fees until such time as the confirmation as referred to above is received from the Bharath University in relation to each of these and any outstanding amounts owed to the Bharath University.
